"""Standalone script: parse the live ollama.com library page and fail loudly
if it comes back empty or suspiciously small. Run by the weekly
catalog-drift-check CI workflow (and by hand: `python -m django_app.catalog.check_live`)
so an ollama.com redesign is caught here instead of by a user opening
`/models` to an empty page — the exact failure mode that started this
overhaul (see catalog/parser.py's module docstring).

Deliberately dependency-light: only needs httpx + beautifulsoup4, not the
full Django app, so CI doesn't need a database or the rest of requirements.txt.
